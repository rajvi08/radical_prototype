## Current Ecosystems

### Personal Data, Data Transfer & Digital Identity

Most digital platforms collect and store user data in centralized systems. This data is shared or sold to third parties, often without clear consent. Users receive free services in return, but have little control over how their data is used.

_How might we give users more control over their data and create value beyond the services offered by companies?_

_How might we build a secure user-owned database that connects to sites, allows selective sharing, and protects private data?_

_How might we design a decentralized data storage system, like a wallet, fully controlled by the user?_
