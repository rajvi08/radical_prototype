## Current Ecosystems

### Personal Data, Data Transfer & Digital Identity

Most digital platforms collect and store user data in centralized systems. This data is shared or sold to third parties, often without clear consent. Users receive free services in return, but have little control over how their data is used.

_How might we give users more control over their data and create value beyond the services offered by companies?_

_How might we build a secure user-owned database that connects to sites, allows selective sharing, and protects private data?_

_How might we design a decentralized data storage system, like a wallet, fully controlled by the user?_

### Laptop Lifecycle

Most laptops today depend on external energy sources, cloud storage, and fixed hardware configurations. When performance needs change, users often replace the entire device rather than upgrade parts. This creates a linear cycle of manufacture, use, and disposal, with limited user control over repair, energy, or data.

_How might we design laptops that generate their own energy and store data locally?_

_How might we build modular laptops that adapt to each userâ€™s needs?_

### Energy Distribution

The current energy system is centralized, with electricity generated at large power plants and transmitted through high-voltage lines to homes and businesses. Residential solar or small-scale generation is limited by regulations, and any excess energy is fed back to the grid. The utility then distributes this energy to other consumers, with homeowners typically receiving credit rather than direct payment from neighbors.

_How might we enable people to sell excess electricity directly to their neighbors instead of only through the grid?_

_How might we simplify global investment in renewable energy by centering it around renewable energy credits?_
