# Radical_Prototype

## Project Overview

Radical_Prototype is a design research project that explores how architectural systems can integrate **energy, data, and infrastructure** into modular, reconfigurable building elements. The project proposes *Modulons* a self-contained architectural unit/block that can generate, store, and distribute resources such as energy, data, air, and water, while being assembled into larger spatial frameworks.

Rather than treating building surfaces as static envelopes, this project frames architecture as an active system composed of interoperable building blocks whose functions adapt to environmental and geographic conditions, such as water extraction from atmospheric humidity in arid regions, air filtration in polluted contexts, or energy generation based on local climatic availability.

## Website Structure & Development

The website was built as a **static web project** using standard web technologies to ensure portability, transparency, and long-term accessibility.

### Core Technologies
- **HTML5** - page structure and semantic layout  
- **CSS3** - typography, layout, visual hierarchy, and responsive behavior  
- **Vanilla JavaScript** - interactivity and dynamic behavior  
- **Three.js** - interactive 3D visualizations (ontology diagrams and system relationships)

---

## Interactive & Visualization Frameworks

- **Three.js** is used to create interactive 3D diagrams that visualize:
  - Energy and data infrastructures
  - Ontological relationships between system components
  - Networked entities and flows  
- **OrbitControls** allow users to explore these diagrams spatially through rotation, zoom, and pan.

### AI was used for: 
- Debugging and optimizing JavaScript logic (especially Three.js interactions)  
- Cursor was used for iterative design changes to the website
