## State of Knowledge of field

Drawing inspiration from the "radical software" movement of the 1970s—which fundamentally reimagined the relationship between technology, media, and society—this course positions prototyping as a critical practice that challenges existing technological paradigms rather than simply optimizing them. A "radical prototype" in this context is not merely a proof of concept or a market-ready solution, but an intervention that questions the underlying assumptions, power structures, and value systems embedded in contemporary technology.

Through hands-on making, students will engage in what we call "critical prototyping"—a recursive process where speculation, material experimentation, and reflexive analysis inform one another. Each prototype serves simultaneously as a functional demonstration, a theoretical argument, and a provocation that asks: What alternative relationships between humans, technology, and society might be possible?

Students will develop working prototypes that embody different logics than those driving mainstream technology development—perhaps prioritizing communal ownership over individual property, mutual aid over competitive advantage, or ecological reciprocity over extractive efficiency. This approach demands that students not only master technical skills but also develop the critical acuity to recognize how their design decisions encode particular worldviews and political possibilities.

By creating artifacts that make alternative futures tangible and debatable, students will learn to wield technology as a medium for cultural critique and social transformation, continuing the radical software tradition of using technical tools to reprogram society itself.


## Research Methods

## Intent of purpose to 'Radical Prototype'

### Aims
This course is intended to help students deepen their interest in their project. It is designed to eliminate blind spots and broaden awareness of how related disciplines have addressed recurring problems, as well as to identify the current state of the art in technology, with particular attention to the critical friction involved in implementation.

During this two-semester requirement, you will work closely with Cornell Tech and AAP faculty and research staff to conduct research on a critical design and technology question or problem and develop an implementable design tech solution for a real human need. Specialization projects take various forms, but every project results in tangible, marketable experience and a completed project that will stand out on your resume. The first semester focuses on the development of a project question, literature review, team building, research methods, and identifying your audience.
